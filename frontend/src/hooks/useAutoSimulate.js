/**
 * Keeps the simulation result in sync with the circuit automatically,
 * mirroring IBM Quantum Composer's live-updating Q-sphere instead of
 * requiring an explicit "Run" click.
 *
 * Watches `gates` AND `qubits` — not just gate placement. Bumping the qubit
 * count changes the register size (and therefore the joint statevector)
 * even if no gate touches the new/removed wire, so it has to re-trigger a
 * simulation exactly like adding a gate does.
 *
 * `steps` is deliberately not watched: it only affects how many empty grid
 * columns are rendered, not the physics, so resizing it shouldn't fire a
 * network request.
 *
 * Debounced so a drag, a multi-click on the qubit +/- buttons, or a few
 * rapid edits in a row only fire one request once things settle — the same
 * "wait for a pause" behavior a live composer needs to avoid hammering the
 * backend on every intermediate state.
